I'm a Product Management and Marketing professional with a background in technology companies, startups, and multifamily. I'm currently a Product Manager contractor at [Knock](https://www.knockcrm.com). Before that I was at Microsoft and prior to that I lead the marketing and product development organizations at a mid-size property management firm - Horizon Realty Advisors.

I have specialized in the technical side of those roles, leadership, and data analysis. I have a good deal of experience in technology in multifamily and I'm currently open for consulting work. Here I'll be blogging about personal projects. If you'd like to talk to me or work together, please don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact)!
